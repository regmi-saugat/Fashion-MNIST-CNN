# Fashion MNIST Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

**Dataset**
- It is a dataset of Zalando's article images â€” consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

**Convolutional Neural Network**
- CNN is specialized type of neural network model designed for workin with image data.
